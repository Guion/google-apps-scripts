# google-apps-scripts
Google Apps scripts for automating data entry and minimizing the impact of updates and re-work.

1. **Global Find and Replace:** Performs a find and replace function across all Google Sheets within a parent directory.
2. **Global Insert Row with Data:** Inserts a row in every Google Sheet within a parent directory, with the option to fill those cells (or any range of cells independent of the added row) with a string of data.

**NOTE - Before running scripts in a given directory, it's a good idea to back up the directory. Since Google Drive won't let you make a copy of a folder, you can... run another script that does that, like [this one](https://www.labnol.org/code/19979-copy-folders-drive.).**
